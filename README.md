# PPMST Case Study
 
This project hosts the output reports of 4 alternative analyses conducted using the PPMST (https://github.com/bnahkala/ppmst). The Rmd file in this project creates the graphic for a short case study manuscript that is included as a chapter of my MS thesis. The flood risk for four potholes were assessed using 5 land management scenarios.
